* change "all_data" key to "overall metric"

go build -v -o ./benchmark.bin && ./benchmark.bin

* try, to create benchmark runner client & to make a decentralized client, so we can achive unique IP address
benchmark server should distribute/assign size & time of API call(could be real time or planned) to the benchmark runner client
& benchmark client should be scalable in a flexible way
i think testing can be done using docker,
& can be released as docker image and the code will be mounted to host drive, so user can write api calls,payload etc
