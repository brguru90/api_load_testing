* change "all_data" key to "overall metric"

go build -v -o ./benchmark.bin && ./benchmark.bin


* auto open web view after server up instead of timeout
* currently sessions & other store are a single variable,
    better to provide it as object, if user need to same store parallely else where then they can use new object 
* bechmark call should accept a name or tittle & same should be returned to the metric dump & response

* try, to create benchmark runner client & to make a decentralized client, so we can achive unique IP address
benchmark server should distribute/assign size & time of API call(could be real time or planned) to the benchmark runner client
& benchmark client should be scalable in a flexible way
i think testing can be done using docker,
& can be released as docker image and the code will be mounted to host drive, so user can write api calls,payload etc
